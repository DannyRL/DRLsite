				<h2 style="color: white; font-weight: bold;"> General </h2>
				<p style="color: #white; text-indent: 2em;"> I am a senior studying Computer Engineering with a hardware emphasis at the University of Florida. I've taken courses involving solid state electronics, circuit analysis, signal processing, programming, computer organization, data structures, computer hardware design, microprocessor applications, and more. </p>

				<br>

				<h2 style="color: white; font-weight: bold;"> Hardware Credentials</h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> I have experience in analyzing and working with electrical components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, MOSFETs, BJTs, and other miscellaneous components to design and build functional circuitry. I know how to use Altium Suite to design PCBs and Solid Works to create 3D object designs.</p>

				<br>

				<h2 style="color: white; font-weight: bold;"> Software Credentials </h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> I have a lot of experience with C and C++ from courses offered at UF and also from working with microprocessors so often. I also know Java, AVR Assembly, and MIPS Assembly. I've taken courses in computer organization, data structures, and am currently taking Operating Systems.   </p>

				<br>

				<h2 style="color: white; font-weight: bold;"> Projects </h2>
				<h3 style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;"> Adaptive Vehicle Suspension System</h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> The controller pictured on the top left of this page was designed and built from scratch by myself as part of a personal project. I'm working on building an adjustable air suspension system for my car. The main advantages to this over a traditional spring and shock system is adjustable ride height and comfort. I'm implementing features such as allowing the user to manually adjust the height of the vehicle, a self-leveling system, and an adaptive ride.</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Whenever weight is added to a vehicle, it typically sags a bit as the springs in the suspension system get compressed. However in my system, the controller will sense this sag in height and raise the car back up. This creates a safer riding condition as all four wheels of the car can be balanced. Also as the car travels along the road, it will encounter bumps. The spring and shock system of traditional cars help to absorb some of the forces experienced by bumps in the road, but they are only reactive at best. My system will actively sense bumps and dips in the road and constantly adjust the suspension so that it will "fight back" against bumpy road conditions. This adds a significant level of comfort to the ride. This project is currently still in a prototype phase, but I hope to complete it early next year.</p>
